# Project Overview

This is a simple tutorial that I built while learning Vue.js, with a series of three articles (link in sections below) that builds an application and deployed to the cloud. We will learn how to use Vue.js and draw data from a free NASA API that provides the Astronomy Picture of the Day (or Video).

Note: The final version of the project source code is in the `gallery` branch.

See this [link](https://nasa-demo-devto.onrender.com/) for the site in action!

# Setup and Configuration

See the steps [here](https://dev.to/stoicllama/build-a-simple-vue-3-app-and-enjoy-astronomy-part-1-of-3-132a) for setup and configuration of the Nasa Demo Application from the vanilla Vue.js application created from Vue CLI.

# Development

See the steps [here](https://dev.to/stoicllama/build-a-simple-vue-3-app-and-enjoy-astronomy-part-2-of-3-27g5) for building the logic to bring pictures and videos from the NASA API into the Vue.js application.

# Deployment

See the steps [here](https://dev.to/stoicllama/build-a-simple-vue-3-app-and-enjoy-astronomy-part-3-of-3-1cc1) for deploying this application from your local computer to the cloud. We will be using Render hosting services, which is free!


# Acknowledgement

Thanks for NASA for providing the free service for curious astronomer-wanne-be's who also like coding.  This post was also inspired by the [VueMastery](https://www.vuemastery.com) course named "Real World Vue" that I highly recommend - no affliation here just a big fan of good educational content.

Any quesitons on this tutorial please post an issue here and I will do my best to answer you or direct you to right resources. Good luck and have fun building!
